This document explains some of the progress the NDI team made on data analysis from Feb 26 - March 2.

The datasets referenced in this file are on the [team GitHub](https://github.com/evantrowbridge/policy_lab_ndi).

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

## Controls for COVID-19 Outcomes

This week, we put together a dataframe of data for each country for the chosen control variables, using the most recent data from each country:

-   GDP per capita

    -   Latest year in data: 2019

-   Gini index

    -   Latest year in data: 2020

-   Median age of population

    -   Latest year in data: uncertain

-   Portion of population age 65 or older

    -   Latest year in data: uncertain

-   Public health expenditure per capita

    -   Latest year in data: 2018

We have discussed including "Public health expenditure as percent of GDP," but it seemed so similar to "Public health expenditure per capita" that I have it commented out in the code below. *How to think about this?*

The code to produce the controls is below.

```{r covid_controls, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

df_all_yr <- read_csv("~/GitHub/policy_lab_ndi/data/merged_data_yr.csv")
df_all_yr_2020 <- read_csv("~/GitHub/policy_lab_ndi/data/merged_data_yr_2020.csv")

# Controls for COVID outcomes
df_covid_controls <- df_all_yr %>%
  arrange(country_standard, year) %>%
  group_by(country_standard) %>%
  # These variables don't have values in 2020. Filling in from most recent year
  fill(
    c(gdp, pub_health_exp_percent_gdp, percap_domestic_health_expenditure)) %>%
  filter(year==2020) %>%
  select(
    country_standard, 
    gdp, 
    pub_health_exp_percent_gdp, 
    percap_domestic_health_expenditure)
  
df_covid_controls <- df_all_yr_2020 %>%
  select(
    country_standard, gdp_per_capita, gini_2020, median_age, aged_65_older) %>%
  full_join(df_covid_controls, by = "country_standard") %>% 
  select(
    country_standard, gdp, gdp_per_capita, gini_2020, 
        # we discussed using "public health expenditure as a proportion of GDP"
        # as an indicator, but it seemed very similar to the next indicator
        # below, which is "public health expenditure per capita"
    #pub_health_exp_percent_gdp, 
    percap_domestic_health_expenditure, 
    median_age, aged_65_older)

```

We visualized how the controls relate with some variables in our data involving COVID-19, corruption, democracy, and transparency using pairplots. (The pairplots were made using differently-prepared control data, but compliments our understanding of the data).

*Is it an endogeneity concern that there seems to be correlation between control variables and transparency variables?*

## Creating an index for COVID-19 health factors

Our COVID-19 index comes from country-level measures starting from January 1, 2020. The measures are used in the following equation:

$(\frac{1}{CasesPerMillion}) (\frac{1}{DeathsPerMillion}) (TestsPerThousand)$

The intuition is that countries will have a higher index score if they have fewer cases, fewer deaths, and more tests. The index is scaled from 0 (worst) to 1 (best).

We decided on this index after testing it among six considered models. We regressed each index on our list of control variables and compared the F-statistic of each model. The chosen model had the second highest F-Statistic, but was chosen because a review of the country rankings of the model with the highest F-statistic revealed it to poorly reflect the reality of comparative outcomes across countries.

To see the code for the process above, see [this portion of the group's GitHub](https://github.com/evantrowbridge/policy_lab_ndi/blob/main/Reference_Code/covid_index_select.r).

The process for making this index can be adapted for the remaining indices our group will be creating.

For countries that were missing data on COVID-19 tests, they are assigned a score of "1" on the scale of 1 (lowest performing) to 10 (highest performing) used for countries' testing rates.

The code to create the index is below:

```{r covid_index, echo=TRUE}

df_covid_index <- df_all_yr %>%
  select(
    country_standard, 
    cum_total_cases_per_million, 
    cum_total_deaths_per_million,
    cum_total_tests_per_thousand) %>%
  filter(
    if_any(
      cum_total_cases_per_million:cum_total_deaths_per_million, 
      ~ !is.na(.))) %>%  
  distinct() %>%
  mutate(
        # Use a scale of 1 - 10 to avoid having "0" in denominator
    stand_total_cases_per_million  = rescale(cum_total_cases_per_million, to = c(1, 10)),
    stand_total_deaths_per_million = rescale(cum_total_deaths_per_million, to = c(1, 10)),
    stand_total_tests_per_thousand = rescale(cum_total_tests_per_thousand, to = c(1, 10)),
    stand_total_tests_per_thousand_no_NA = ifelse(
      is.na(stand_total_tests_per_thousand), 
      1, 
      stand_total_tests_per_thousand),
    covid_index = rescale(
      (1/stand_total_cases_per_million) +
      (1/stand_total_deaths_per_million) +
      stand_total_tests_per_thousand_no_NA)
    ) %>%
  select(country_standard, covid_index, everything())

# Reviewing distribution of the data
histogram(df_covid_index$stand_total_cases_per_million)
histogram(df_covid_index$stand_total_deaths_per_million)
histogram(df_covid_index$stand_total_tests_per_thousand_no_NA)
histogram(df_covid_index$covid_index)

# RUnning a regression of control variables on COVID-19 index
covid_index_mod_test <- df_covid_index %>% 
  select(country_standard, covid_index) %>%
  full_join(df_covid_controls, by = "country_standard") %>%
  select(-country_standard)

  lm(covid_index ~ ., data = covid_index_mod_test) %>% summary()

```

## Creating an Index for Corruption Indicators

The index for corruption indicators combines Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index (CPI) and the World Bank Worldwide Governance Indicator's Control of Corruption (CoC) index.

It standardizes both indicators on a scale of 0 (worst) to 1 (best).

It then creates two options for indices:

Option One is a sum of the two indicators:

$(CPIscaled) + (CoCscaled)$

Option Two is the average of the two indicators:

$\frac{(CPIscaled) + (CoCscaled)}{2}$

```{r}
